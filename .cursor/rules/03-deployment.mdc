# Deployment and Infrastructure

## SST Configuration
The project uses SST (Serverless Stack) for infrastructure, defined in [sst.config.ts](mdc:sst.config.ts).

## Development
- Use `bun run dev` for local development
- The development environment uses local emulation of AWS services
- API endpoints are available locally during development

## Deployment Process
- Main branch deployments are automated
- Infrastructure changes must be reviewed
- Follow the principle of infrastructure as code
- All infrastructure changes must be made through SST configuration

## Environment Variables
- Never commit sensitive values to the repository
- Use SST's Secret management for sensitive values
- Local development uses .env files (not committed to repo)
